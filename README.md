[![Mod Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Hawkbat/LobotomySaveDataProfiles)](https://github.com/Hawkbat/LobotomySaveDataProfiles/releases)

A mod for the game Lobotomy Corporation that allows for creating and switching between multiple separate save files in-game.

The vanilla save files in "%UserProfile%/AppData/LocalLow/Project_Moon/Lobotomy" are left alone and used if the "default profile" is selected. Custom save profiles are saved in "LobotomyCorp/LobotomyCorp_Data/Saves".
